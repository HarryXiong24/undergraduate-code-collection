# Passing mutable lists or dictionaries as default arguments to a function can have unforeseen consequences.
# Usually when a programmer uses a list or dictionary as the default argument to a function,
# the programmer wants the program to create a new list or dictionary every time that the function is called.
# However, this is not what Python does. The first time that the function is called,
# Python creates a persistent object for the list or dictionary. Every subsequent time the function is called,
# Python uses that same persistent object that was created from the first call to the function.
